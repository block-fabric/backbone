# The unified Chains app

One app for Chains and its sidechains. Status: **design + phase 1 prototype** (branch `unified-app`,
not merged). Written 2026-10-20.

## 0. What the user decided (2026-10-20)

- Built **into the Chains app** (`chains-app`, in-process `chainsd` + HTML UI in `src/webui`), not a separate app.
- **Chains standalone by default.** Sidechains are opt-in in *Settings → Sidechains*: enable / disable.
  Disabling stops the daemon and keeps data and keys; deleting data is a separate action.
  FastBlocks and Layers get an optional "stake on this chain".
- **Wallets:** default = **one seed for everything** (one backup phrase; each chain derives its keys
  from it on its own path). Optional per chain = a separate wallet.
- **Data directories:** default = one place, `<Chains datadir>/sidechains/<name>/`. Optional per chain =
  a custom folder (another disk), changeable later with a guided move.
- **Onboarding wizards** where useful: first run, enable a sidechain, move coins into a sidechain.

Everything below serves those decisions. Points that still need the user are collected in §12.

```

Each sidechain stays **its own daemon** (`<stem>d`, unchanged code, its own consensus, its own
datadir and wallet). The app *supervises* them; it never links sidechain consensus code. This keeps
the sidechain repos independent, lets a sidechain crash without taking Chains down, and lets a
daemon be upgraded on its own (§8).

### 1.1 Process supervision

- **One supervisor thread** does every `fork`/`exec`. A child gets its own process group (a Ctrl+C
  in a terminal does not reach it), `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG=SIGTERM` (Linux: if the app dies, the daemon
  shuts down cleanly instead of being orphaned — the death signal is tied to the *thread* that forked,
  hence the single long-lived thread), an empty signal mask, `nice +5`, stdin `/dev/null`, stdout and
  stderr appended to `<home>/supervisor.log`, every other fd closed. `exec` failure is reported through
  a close-on-exec pipe.
- **States:** `disabled → stopped → starting → running → stopping`, plus `crashed` and `failed`.
  `running` means the daemon answered `getblockcount` over RPC (warm-up done).
- **Restart policy:** a daemon that exits without being asked is restarted after 2 s, 5 s, 15 s,
  30 s, 60 s; after the fifth failure it is `failed` (shown in red with the end of its log) and
  stays down until the user turns it on again. Ten minutes of good running resets the count.
- **Stop:** `SIGTERM` (bitcoind-style clean shutdown: flush, wallet close), `SIGKILL` after
  `stop_timeout` (120 s). Disabling returns at once; the UI shows `stopping` until the exit is reaped.
- **Windows (phase 2):** `CreateProcess` into a Job object with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`
  (the PDEATHSIG equivalent), stop via the daemon's `stop` RPC then `TerminateProcess` after the
  timeout. **macOS:** no PDEATHSIG; the daemon gets an inherited pipe and a new `-exitwithparentfd=<n>`
  option (shut down on EOF) — a small change in sidechain-template, merged down to every sidechain.

### 1.2 Ports

Every sidechain already has its own default ports: RPC `<net>9<code>54`, P2P `<net>9<code>55`
(`net`: main 0, testnet 1, regtest 2, signet 3; `code`: FastBlocks 1, Layers 2, BitAssets 3, zSide 4,
template 6, Thunder 7, Hivemind 8, BitNames 9). The supervisor uses them, checks both are free before
starting (a clear "port in use: another Layers node runs?" instead of a crash loop), and takes a
per-chain override from the settings (`rpcPort`, `port`). Tests use `-sidechainportbase=<p>`
(RPC `p+2i`, P2P `p+2i+1`).

### 1.3 Authentication

- **Daemon → Chains:** the app adds an `-rpcauth` entry for user `chains-app-sidechains` with a
  **fresh random password every run** (HMAC-hashed in the args, as `share/rpcauth` does). The password
  is written to `<datadir of the sidechain>/mainchain.rpcpass` (owner-only, atomic, via
  `WriteSecretFile`) and passed as `-mainchainrpcpasswordfile` — never on a command line (any local
  user can read those). The user's own `-rpcauth`/cookie keep working.
- **Phase 2 hardening:** `-rpcwhitelist=chains-app-sidechains:<the methods sidechains use>` (BMM
  requests, `getsidechainevents`, block/header reads, deposit lookups) so a compromised sidechain
  daemon cannot call `dumpwallet`/`sendtoaddress` on the Chains wallet. Needs the exact list from the
  template's `MainchainClient` (+ `-mainchainrpcwallet` for BMM).
- **App → daemon:** the daemon's own cookie (`<datadir>/<net>/.cookie`), read per call.

### 1.4 The RPC server of Chains starts late, and only when needed

A Chains-only user has no RPC server today (`-server` off). Sidechains need one. New:
`interfaces::Node::startRpcServer()` → `AppStartServersLate()` (init.cpp) runs `AppInitServers`
after `AppInitMain` — once, only when the first sidechain is enabled (or at start if one is). It
binds to localhost unless the user configured otherwise; shutdown already stops the HTTP/RPC
servers unconditionally. **Standalone users are unaffected:** no server, no supervisor thread, no
child process, no extra memory (verified by `run_unified.py`, §11).

### 1.5 Auto-wiring (exact arguments)

```
<stem>d -datadir=<dir> [-testnet|-signet|-regtest -sidechainslot=<slot>]
        -server=1 -rpcport=<R> -port=<P> -printtoconsole=0
        -mainchainrpcconnect=127.0.0.1 -mainchainrpcport=<Chains RPC port>
        -mainchainrpcuser=chains-app-sidechains -mainchainrpcpasswordfile=<dir>/mainchain.rpcpass
        -dbcache=100 -maxmempool=100   [+ -sidechainarg values, tests only]
```

### 1.6 Health, logs, resources

- **Health:** process alive + RPC answers (`running`); *in step with Chains* = the daemon's
  `getmainchaininfo` is connected and has seen Chains' tip height. Phase 2 adds liveness (RPC timing
  out for > 60 s → restart) and stall detection (Chains advanced 3 blocks, the sidechain's mainchain
  view did not → warning with its error).
- **Logs:** the daemon's own `debug.log` in its datadir; `supervisor.log` (start lines with the full
  argv, anything the daemon printed before its log opened, crash output). "Show its log" in the UI
  shows both tails. Phase 2: cap `supervisor.log` at 1 MB (rotate once).
- **Resources:** modest caches (`-dbcache=100 -maxmempool=100`), `nice +5`. Phase 2: per-chain
  prune (≥ 10 GB, the network minimum the user chose), a cgroup v2 / Job-object memory cap per daemon,
  "pause sidechains on battery".

### 1.7 Shutdown order

Quit → the page shows "shutting down" → **all sidechain daemons get `SIGTERM` at once** → the app
waits for all of them (≤ 120 s, then `SIGKILL`) → **then** the Chains node shuts down. Sidechains go
first because they depend on Chains (BMM, deposits, the follower); stopping Chains first makes them
log errors and possibly start a withdrawal/BMM step against a disappearing node. Settings stay
"enabled" so the next start brings them back.

---

## 2. Per-chain RPC routing for the pages

- **Phase 1 (done):** host methods `sidechains.list / enable / disable / chooseDataDir / setDataDir /
  deleteData / overview / log / rpc`. `sidechains.rpc {stem, method, params, wallet?}` forwards only
  an **allowlist of read methods** (`getblockchaininfo`, `getmainchaininfo`, `getbalances`,
  `listtransactions`, …). Anything else is refused in the host, not in the page.
- **Phase 2:** the bridge gains a chain on RPC requests: `{kind: 'rpc', chain: 'layers', method,
  params}`. The host routes `chain = chains|absent` to the in-process node and any other chain to the
  supervisor's client for that daemon, under **that chain's RpcPolicy** — the same table each sidechain
  app already ships (`src/webui/rpcpolicy.cpp` in each repo), compiled into the Chains app per chain.
  Methods that move coins go through the trusted dialog (§6), never straight through.
- Events: the supervisor emits `sidechains {stem}` on every state change; phase 2 adds per-chain tip
  events (`tip@layers`) from a light poll (or a ZMQ/`-blocknotify` hook) so sidechain pages refresh like
  Chains pages do.

## 3. Bundling the sidechains' pages at build time

Each sidechain app has its pages in `src/webui/app/src/chain/` (+ `chain.json`). The unified app
builds them in **as lazy chunks**:

1. Each sidechain repo gets `npm run pack` → `dist/pack/<stem>/` (an ES module exporting its pages,
   its nav entries and its `chain.json`) + `pack.json`:
   `{stem, version, commit, kitApi, rpcPolicy, daemon: {min, max}}`.
2. Chains has `src/webui/sidechains.json` pinning each pack to a repo **commit** (not a branch). The
   CMake step (`npm_build.cmake`) fetches/builds the pinned packs (a shallow git fetch into the build
   dir; offline builds use a local mirror path) and vite emits them as dynamic `import()` chunks.
   A Chains-only user never loads them: no memory cost.
3. **Compatibility checks.** The UI kit lives in Chains (`src/webui`) and flows down to the
   sidechains (user decision 2026-10-14). Each pack declares the `kitApi` it was built against; the
   build fails on a mismatch, so a kit change forces the packs to be bumped together. At runtime the
   host compares the daemon's version (`getnetworkinfo.subversion`, later a `getuiinfo` RPC) with the
   pack's `daemon` range; outside it, the chain is shown **read-only with "update needed"**.
4. **Where daemon binaries come from.**
   - **Phase 1:** bundled — the release package puts `layersd`, `fastblocksd`, … next to
     `chains-app` (found via `/proc/self/exe`; dev builds use `-sidechainbindir`). Cost: ≈ 25–60 MB
     per daemon. Option: two packages, "Chains" and "Chains + sidechains" (§12).
   - **Phase 4 (#9):** download on enable from a **signed manifest**: a JSON per release train
     (`stem, platform, version, url, sha256, size, minApp`) signed with an ed25519 release key compiled
     into the app. The existing download path of `sidechainnodes.cpp` (https only, sha256 before
     unpacking, native confirm dialog) is reused, plus signature verification of the manifest.
     Binaries live in `<home>/bin/<version>/`; the previous version is kept for rollback.

## 4. Wallets

### 4.1 Single seed (default)

- **Seed:** BIP39, 12 words (24 allowed on restore), optional passphrase (advanced). Master key via
  BIP32.
- **One account per chain, hardened:** `m/86'/C'/A'` (taproot, the default) and `m/84'/C'/A'`
  (segwit v0, for chains or tools that need it). `C` = the Chains coin type (one number for the whole
  family, §12). `A` = **0 for Chains**; for a sidechain, `A = u32(SHA256("chains/account" ‖ genesis
  hash of the sidechain)) & 0x7fffffff`. Deterministic, needs no registry, distinct per chain *and*
  per network (genesis differs), and a slot later reused by another sidechain gets other keys.
- **How a daemon gets its keys:** the hub derives the **account-level xprv** and imports
  `tr(<acct xprv>/0/*)` and `tr(<acct xprv>/1/*)` (+ `wpkh` equivalents) into a **blank descriptor
  wallet** `main` of the daemon (`createwallet main … blank=true`, `importdescriptors`). The daemon
  only ever holds its own account key: hardened derivation means a compromised Layers daemon cannot
  derive Chains' or FastBlocks' keys, nor the seed.
- **xpub-only alternative:** daemon wallets watch-only, the hub signs PSBTs. Stronger isolation but
  every spend, every BMM bid and every staking signature must round-trip through the hub; staking
  (FastBlocks/Layers) signs continuously. Keep xprv-in-daemon as default; offer xpub-only later with
  hardware wallets (phase 5).
- **Chain-specific key material:** zSide's Orchard keys via ZIP-32 from the same BIP39 seed (its own
  coin type path); FastBlocks/Layers **validator keys** on a separate hardened branch
  `m/86'/C'/A'/2'/i'` so a validator key can be rotated without touching coins; Hivemind's Votecoin
  keys are ordinary wallet keys of its account.
- **Encryption:** the seed lives in the hub, in `<datadir>/seed.dat`, encrypted (scrypt → AES-256-GCM)
  with the wallet passphrase. Every daemon wallet is encrypted with the **same passphrase**
  (`encryptwallet` right after import). "Unlock" in the app unlocks the seed and, on demand, the one
  daemon wallet that needs it (`walletpassphrase` with the same timeout); a passphrase change is applied
  to the seed and every enabled chain, with rollback if one fails. Chains' own wallet is the account
  `A=0` wallet, made the same way.
- **Backup & restore:** the 12 words restore **everything**. Restore: the user types the words
  (+ optional "about when did you create it?" to bound rescans); the hub creates the Chains wallet and,
  for each sidechain enabled, the blank wallet + imported descriptors with `timestamp` = that date
  (or the sidechain's genesis — sidechains are young, a full rescan is cheap). Rescans run in the
  background per chain, shown per chain in the switcher ("restoring, 40 %").
- **Existing users:** existing Chains wallets stay as they are. The app offers "create your backup
  phrase" → a new seed wallet, and a guided "move your coins to it" (a normal send to self). Never an
  automatic sweep.

### 4.2 Separate wallet (per chain, optional)

The daemon creates its own wallet (what phase 1 does for every chain). The UI marks it
"separate — needs its own backup", offers *Back up this wallet* (`backupwallet` to a file the user
chooses) and reminds once a week until done. Switching separate → shared later = new seed wallet on
that chain + a guided send; never automatic.

## 5. Data directories

```
<Chains datadir>/                 Chains (blocks/, chainstate/, wallets/, regtest/ …)
  sidechains/
    layers/
      data/                       -datadir of layersd (its testnet/ regtest/ inside)
        mainchain.rpcpass         0600, rewritten at every start
      bin/                        phase 4 downloads (by version)
      supervisor.log
    fastblocks/ …
```

The `data/` level is shared with the existing *Sidechains → Nodes* tab, so a sidechain started either
way finds the same chain and wallet.

- **Custom folder per chain**, chosen in the desktop's own folder chooser (the page cannot type a
  path: `setDataDir` only takes the folder last chosen there, or "default"). Checks: absolute path; not
  inside Chains' data (except `sidechains/`); not inside or around another sidechain's data; the
  nearest existing parent is writable; free space vs the chain's estimate (red below, amber within
  10 GB).
- **Move wizard** (phase 1 has the engine; the full wizard is phase 2): turn off → choose folder →
  checks (above) → "Move what it downloaded (N GB)?" → rename on the same disk (instant), else copy
  with progress, verify (file count and sizes), then remove the old copy (or keep it, user's choice)
  → turn on. A failed copy leaves everything as it was.
- **Delete data**: only while off; asked in a **native** dialog. Default keeps `wallets/` and
  `settings.json` (blocks and state go: it resyncs); "everything, wallets too" is a separate, louder
  choice (phase 2 UI) that says coins whose keys are only there are lost.

## 6. Security of spends from the unified app

**Phase 1 is read-only for sidechains**, enforced in the host (allowlist; tested). The pages can
watch, never spend.

Phase 2 must give sidechain spends the same guarantee Chains spends have today (`webui/confirm.cpp`:
the host decodes what a call does, asks in a native dialog the page can neither draw nor answer, then
runs exactly the call it described). Each sidechain app already has a describer table for its own
RPCs (its `confirm.cpp`: rows for destinations, amounts, fees, two-step reveals). Two ways to use them:

- **A. Shared describer library in the hub.** Each sidechain's describers compiled into the Chains app,
  with `Call::Read` bound to that daemon's RPC.
  + no daemon change. − The hub carries chain-specific semantics for 7+ chains and must be rebuilt for
  every RPC change of any of them; a hub/daemon version skew can *mis-describe* a call (the worst
  failure for a confirmation); breaks download-on-enable of a newer daemon.
- **B. Daemon "describe for confirmation" RPC + hub-side binding (recommended).** Each daemon gets
  `describeconfirmation <method> <canonical params>` → `{rows, digest}`, built from the describers it
  already has (moved from its webui into its RPC layer). The hub: canonicalizes the params itself,
  asks for the description, **verifies what it can independently** (generic tx decoding of the
  resulting PSBT/tx for amounts, standard destinations and fee where the chain uses Bitcoin-style
  transactions), shows the rows in the native dialog with the chain's name in fixed words, then runs
  **exactly the canonical array it had described** (bound by the digest; the page cannot swap it).
  + chain knowledge stays in the chain's code, versioned with the daemon; the hub stays generic;
  works with downloaded daemons. − one RPC per chain (mechanical: the describers exist).
  The daemon is trusted code we ship and it holds the keys anyway; the adversary the dialog defends
  against is a compromised **page**, which B fully covers.

**Recommendation: B**, with A's generic parts (rows, canonical params, two-step authorizations) kept
in the shared kit so both the standalone sidechain apps and the hub use the same code.

## 7. Upgrades

- **Release trains.** An app release ships (or its manifest names) daemon versions tested together.
  At start the hub reads each daemon's version; outside the pack's range → read-only + "update needed".
- **Hard forks.** The manifest carries `activation_height` per chain for a fork; before it the hub shows
  "update Layers before Chains block N (about 3 days)"; past it with an old daemon, the chain is
  stopped with a clear message (it would follow the wrong rules).
- **Data format changes** (e.g. a store layout bump that rebuilds state): flagged in the manifest so
  the hub warns "rebuilds its data on first start, about N minutes" instead of looking stuck.
- **App vs daemon order:** the app is updated first; it accepts the previous daemon version
  (`daemon.min`) so sidechains keep running while their new binaries download (phase 4).

## 8. Wizards (screens and copy)

Plain words, one decision per screen, "recommended" marked, every choice changeable later in
Settings. The prototype has the first two (screenshots in `media/unified-app/`).

**First run** (prototype: *Settings → Sidechains → Setup guide*; becomes the first start in phase 3
when the seed exists):
1. *Welcome* — "Chains is a coin with sidechains: other chains, each good at something, that your
   Chains coins can move into and back out of." What the setup does, how long.
2. *Your wallet* — Create a new wallet / Restore from a backup phrase.
3. *Backup phrase* — 12 words in a numbered grid; "Anyone with them can take your coins; without them,
   a lost computer means lost coins." Checkbox "I wrote the words down" gates Next. (Phase 3: then a
   3-word check.) / *Restore* — word box, live "9 words · 12 or 24 are needed".
4. *Network* — which network the app is on, in words ("the test network: coins for trying things out,
   worth nothing").
5. *Pick sidechains* — cards with a one-line purpose and "about 4 GB of disk and 400 MB of memory";
   running total; programs missing are greyed with "not on this computer".
6. *Storage* (only if any picked) — "All together, with Chains" (path shown, recommended) / "I will
   choose a folder for each" (→ Settings).
7. *What happens next* — Chains syncs first; sidechains follow; the switcher shows each; then "move
   coins into a sidechain". Finish turns the picked ones on with a per-chain progress list.
Edge cases: skip at any time (nothing changes); a sidechain fails to start → shown in the list with
its error, the others continue; restore with chains already enabled → rescans are queued per chain.

**Enable a sidechain** (prototype): *What it is* (purpose, what runs, resources, free-space check) →
*Where its data goes* (with Chains / a folder of my choice + chooser, move existing data) → *Its
wallet* (my backup phrase / separate) → *Staking* (Layers, FastBlocks; phase 1 shows it disabled:
"comes with sending on sidechains") → *Ready* (review) → *On* ("Its node is starting in the background…
Show it"). Edge cases: not enough room (Next disabled, red), folder refused (reason shown), program
missing (toggle explains), port in use (error from the supervisor, stays off).

**Turn off** — page question "Its node stops. Its data and its keys stay on this computer." **Delete
data** — native dialog (blocks and state; wallets kept). **Move data** — see §5.

**Move coins into a sidechain** (phase 2; the Chains app has deposits already): pick sidechain
(only enabled + synced ones, else "turn it on first") → amount (with Chains balance, fee) → "to your
Layers wallet" (the address comes from the daemon of that chain: no copy-paste) → native
confirmation → progress: "sent on Chains" → "seen by Layers after N blocks" (the deposit tracker of
the Sidechains page) → "available on Layers". Withdrawals back to Chains are explained as slow
(bundles, votes) with the expected time.

## 9. Phasing and effort

| Phase | Content | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **1** (this branch) | Supervisor (Linux), late RPC server, Settings → Sidechains, chain switcher, read-only overview, wizard skeletons, tests | done (≈ 3 days) |
| **2** | Per-chain RPC routing + sidechain pages bundled as lazy packs (read-only first), Windows supervisor (Job objects), rpcwhitelist, liveness/stall detection, move-data wizard with progress, packages with daemons bundled | 2–3 weeks |
| **3** | Single seed: BIP39 + derivation + `seed.dat`, blank-wallet import per chain, unified encryption/unlock, backup/restore with rescans, first-run wizard as the real first start, separate-wallet path, existing-user migration | 2–3 weeks |
| **4** | Spends from the hub: `describeconfirmation` in the template → all sidechains, hub binding + native dialog, deposit wizard, staking for FastBlocks/Layers; download-on-enable with signed manifests (#9), upgrade/fork banners | 3–4 weeks |
| **5** | macOS (`-exitwithparentfd`), hardware wallets / xpub-only mode, resource caps (cgroups/Job memory), battery pause, remove the old *Nodes* tab | 2 weeks |

## 10. What the prototype does (phase 1)

- `src/webui/supervisor.{h,cpp}` — catalog (Layers, FastBlocks, Thunder, BitNames, BitAssets, zSide,
  Hivemind), settings per network in the app settings (`sidechains:<net>`), process supervision,
  auto-wiring, data dirs (default/custom/move/delete keeping wallets), read-only RPC, overview.
- `src/init.cpp` `AppStartServersLate`, `interfaces::Node::startRpcServer`.
- `src/webui/app.cpp` — `-rpcauth` for the sidechains user (fresh per run), supervisor made when the
  node is ready, enabled ones started, all stopped before the node at shutdown; host methods
  `sidechains.*`; options `-sidechainbindir`, `-sidechainportbase`, `-sidechainarg`.
- UI: `lib/unified.ts` (logic), `lib/sidechains.svelte.ts` (state), `components/ChainSwitcher`,
  `SidechainSettings`, `EnableWizard`, `FirstRunWizard`, `pages/SidechainView`.
- Not in phase 1: spending on sidechains, the single seed (screens only), sidechain pages, Windows/macOS
  supervision, downloads.

## 11. Tests

- `src/webui/test/supervisor_tests.cpp` — ports, auto-wiring args (no password on argv), rpcauth line,
  read-only allowlist, data dir checks/move/delete, standalone runs nothing; **with a real `layersd`**
  (`CHAINS_TEST_SIDECHAIN_BINDIR=…/layers/build_rel/bin`) wired to a real `chainsd`: start, connected to
  the mainchain, wallet made, overview, SIGKILL → restarted as another process, disable → clean
  shutdown, data moved to another folder and started from there, StopAll.
- `src/webui/app/src/test/unified.test.ts` (vitest) — words, switcher, wizard steps/plans, components.
- `src/webui/test/e2e/run_unified.py` + `unified.js` — the real app on regtest: standalone (no RPC
  port, no supervisor thread, no daemon) → Layers on through the wizard → daemon is a child of the app
  with the right arguments, Chains' RPC server now listens → the runner has Layers make 3 blocks by
  BMM (as a miner would) → switcher shows Layers in step with Chains, its blocks, keeps up with new blocks → spend refused, read allowed → first-run guide screens → off → daemon gone,
  "Shutdown done" in its log → app exits cleanly, nothing left running.

Run: `run_unified.py --app build_app/bin/chains-app --sidechain-bindir ~/skydoge/layers/build_rel/bin
[--sidechain-bindir ~/skydoge/fastblocks/build_rel/bin] --tmp … --shots …` (or ctest `webui_e2e_unified`
with `-DWEBUI_E2E_SIDECHAIN_BINDIR=…`). Pictures of the prototype (Midnight): `~/skydoge/media/unified-app/`.

## 12. Open questions for the user

1. **Coin type `C`** for the single-seed paths: register a SLIP-44 number for Chains, or pick one
   unregistered? (One number for the whole family; sidechains are separated by the account index.)
2. **Bundle size:** ship one package with all daemons (≈ +250 MB unpacked), or "Chains" and
   "Chains + sidechains" packages until download-on-enable (phase 4)?
3. **Spend confirmations:** OK with option **B** (daemon `describeconfirmation` RPC + hub binding)?
4. **Staking keys:** derive validator keys from the seed (one backup) or keep them separate
   (rotatable, not exposed by a seed leak)? Proposed: derived, on their own branch.
5. **The old *Sidechains → Nodes* tab** (start/stop/download by hand): remove once the supervisor
   covers Windows (phase 2), or keep for advanced users and custom sidechains?
6. **Existing wallets:** offer the move to a seed wallet on first start of the new version, or only
   from Settings?
7. **Testnet hub machines** run sidechains as separate apps today; should the unified app become the
   hub's way of running them (after phase 2), or keep separate daemons there?
